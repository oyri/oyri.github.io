## Lights
The cabin has smart lighting which you can control through light switches that all support dimming.

In the hallway, by the entrance door, there is a light switch with two buttons, the top row switches lights on/off in the hallway, the bottom row all lights in the entire cabin.

<img src="../img/info/light_switch_2_hall.png" alt="Light switch in hallway" style="max-width:200px; height:auto;"/>

There are two categories of light switches. If the switch does not work on the first press, then press a second time. (We can control lights from different switches, so if lights are turned off in a different way than the current switch, you have to press 2 times).


### Light Switch Types:
- **Multiple Lights**:
  - On: press `1`, Off: press `0`  
  - Dimming: Hold `1` to dim up, `0` to dim down

- **Single Light**:
  - On/Off: press left power button  
  - Dimming: Hold the "sun" button (dims opposite of previous)

## Heating
There is heating in the floor of the hallway, living room, kitchen and bathroom in addition to the bathroom upstairs. This is control of the washroom, but do not adjust the control panel here. It takes time for the heat to change since it is waterborne.
If it is too cold, notify the home owner. If it's too hot, try to air it out and close the doors to the bedroom. It is also possible to adjust the heat up and down on black thermostats with a display that you find on the walls of the first floor hallway, living room or bathrooms.

## Drinking Water
In Norway you can normally drink tap water, but there have been problems with the well that are not completely fixed yet. We have drunk the water ourselves without problems throughout the winter, but as a guest we want to inform you about this so that you can choose for yourself. The tap water is just fine for cooking, showering, brushing teeth, washing up and likewise.

We have provided a 5L can in the refrigerator for drinking water that can be refilled from 20L containers outside (behind the cabin in the shadow). Please do not remove the cans/containers from the cabin when you leave.
